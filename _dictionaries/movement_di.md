## Why

This dictionary allows you to edit text on a Mac at a much greater capacity. You can move the cursor by letter, word, or line, select while doing so, and also backspace or forward delete by character, word, or line.

## How

As per Plover's default, you use `-R`, `-P`, `-B`, and `-G` for left, up, down, and right.

Use `STPH-` for moving by character, `STPH-RB` to jump a word left, and `STPH-BG` to jump a word right.

Use `KPH-` to use Command ⌘, jumping to line beginning and ending, file top and bottom.

Use `STP-` (**s**hi**f**t) to select characters with movement keys. Again, `-RB` and `-BG` work by word.

Use `SHR-` (**s**e**l**ect) to select words with the movement keys. (This and the strokes described above actually add redundant strokes for selecting whole words to the left and right.)

Use `PW*` and `-F`, `-FP`, or `-FPL` for backspacing a character, a word, or a line.

Use `PW*` and `-R`, `-RB`, or `-RBG` for forward deleting a character, a word, or a line.

Use `KPHR-` for Command + Option (⌘⌥) movements (usually for navigating tabs and file trees).

Use `SP-B` to space up/forward and `SP-P` to space down/backward. That is, in the browser use the former stroke to page up and the latter to page down (this is using ⇧Space).

Use `THRAB` for ⌥ ⇓ and `THRAP` for ⌥ ⇑.

Use `TW-` and a direction for tabbing. Adding `-F`/`-L` gives you ⌘⇧[/⌘⇧] to switch tabs forward and backward. Adding `-B`/`-G` gives you ⌘\`/⌘⇧\` to switch windows forward and backward. Adding `-G`/`-R` gives you ⌘Tab/⌘⇧Tab to switch applications forward and backward. Adding a star to `TW*G` gives you ⌘Tab Tab to switch 2 applications.
