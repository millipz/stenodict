## Why

This is a really cool dictionary. I'll describe it in about one paragraph. It's really great because when you use it you can write more words with the steno machine and it makes you cooler.

## How

Here you can extend on how to use the dictionary, offer tips and advice.

Feel free to spread out across multiple paragraphs...

- Use a bulleted list.
- Make your points.
- You can show raw steno: `STKPWHRAO*EUFRPBLGTSDZ`
- `STK`: "and"

And that's why you should use my dictionary!
